1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

I was hired by a company called "The Gaming Room". I was tasked to convert their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," to a web-based multi-platform game. The requirements were that they needed a design that would work across Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile devices. Lastly, I had to make sure that I had multiple layers of security and that the game ran smoothly to attract more users globally. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I did very well picking out the correct OS. I researched why Linux would be best for this particular game. For example, one of the pros is the security and performance of a server platform is a great option. Linux also operates on a significant percentage of the planet's web servers. However, a bad thing about picking Linux is that I would need to have the right expertise to manage it because the OS has complexities. I believe that over time I also familiarized myself with UML diagrams because at first, I struggled severely as I never had experience with them. I also appreciated learning the difference between memory management and storage management.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When working through the design document I found it helpful when developing the code to view it as a blueprint for coding. This helped me to plan for possible problems and plan ahead of time to be ahead of the curve. I also spent a lot of time on trial and error, so having the  design document to refer to did put me in a better position to succeed.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I did not do very well on my 4-2 Assignment: Game Player Management Application. I could have depicted vehicle and TwoWheeled classes because they should be as empty classes without methods. Also, I could have removed the stereotypical usage from the arrows. From what I have learned and feedback I have received, in my UML diagrams could have implemented the inheritance with simple arrows with closed, empty arrowheads.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I would utilize more time with user testing in the future to guarantee that my code is in line with user expectations and needs. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it could be costly with money and time to not follow the requirements. Coding the wrong requirements could be disappointing to the team and client which is why it is important to find mistakes early in the SDLC as opposed to late in the process.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I enjoyed learning about software design as there are many moving pieces I was not aware of. The approach I found comfort with is working backward from the final goals/requirements. I would utilize more of my resources and be able to focus on user testing in the future to guarantee expectations and needs. I kept in mind to provide cost-effective code, at the same time I had to keep in mind that if another developer were to jump in due to my absence the code would need to be clean and easy to read.
